# Problem statement

DevNation investors are looking to understand how students are engaging in the program, so your job as a data scientists is to use basic statistical methods to summarize and explain the data, so investors can have a better idea of how students are engaging in the program. 

   #####   _Hint : You can summarize and explain as you see fit._
   
  ### Hint: Investors would be really interested to know the following

- Plot a box whisker diagram to represent median, upper quartile, lower quartile, and range of time spend in the class.

 ### Hint: To solve this use-case, you would need to know how to perform the following

* Read-write files using pandas
* Grouping data using pandas and SQL
* Data visualization using plotly
     - Line chart
     - Bar chart
     - Histogram
